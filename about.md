I’m an engineer specialized in data science, with a strong interest in economics and the dynamics of complex markets, especially in the energy sector. 

Over the past few years, I’ve worked as a consultant across the insurance and energy industries. I graduated from [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/) in 2020, where I developed a strong foundation in statistics, economics, and data science. I started my career in insurance, helping companies leverage data to better understand customer behavior and risk. I worked on several modeling projects for major insurance companies including the development of future cash flow projection modules in the actuarial tool Prophet and the automation of financial reporting processes using Dataiku. I also conducted statistical analyses on contract cancellations to improve forecasting of key business flows (premiums, claims, expenses). This experience gave me a solid grounding in how to structure data problems that impact business outcomes.

Since 2022, I’ve shifted my focus to the energy world where I've found an environment that perfectly blends technical modeling, economic reasoning, and real-world impact. I now work closely with energy companies, helping them optimize their operations and decision-making through advanced data analysis. This has included building tools to analyze Clean Spark Spreads, developing algorithms for optimizing CCGT plant operations, and creating dashboards that help asset managers and analysts monitor market opportunities. My recent experiences have also led me to further develop my skills in Power BI, data visualization, and presentation, to ensure that the insights I produce have the strongest possible business impact.

My goal is always the same: to bridge the gap between data and business impact, and to make complex things simple, actionable, and valuable.

## Work Experience

**2023 – Present**  
**Lead Consultant — Data & Energy Markets**  
*Irex Consulting*  
I currently work as a Lead Consultant at Irex Consulting, a business engineering consultancy firm well established among players in the energy sector in Western Europe. I have an active role in developing the company's data offering and work on energy management and data-related topics for clients across Europe (France, Belgium, UK, Sweden).

**2020 – 2023**  
**Data Science & Actuarial Consultant**  
*Seabird*  
I worked as a consultant for several major insurance companies in France. The global context of these years in the insurance sector included the implementation of IFRS 17 principles and requirements. Most of my projects were linked to this standard with a strong data component: I built actuarial models, automated reporting processes, and developed statistical analyses to support key business decisions.

**2019 – 2020**  
**Apprenticeship — Data Science & Actuarial Modeling**  
*Seabird*  
During my final year at ENSAE Paris, I completed an apprenticeship at Seabird, a consulting company specialized in the insurance and banking sectors. My work consisted in supporting experienced consultants on their projects, and I also developed an NLP tool capable of extracting and analyzing CSR-related information from the annual reports of insurance companies.
