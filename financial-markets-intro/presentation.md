title: Financial Markets & Instruments — Introduction
permalink: /financial-markets_intro/
---


Welcome to this course on financial markets and financial instruments.

It all began as a four-hour class I gave to bachelor students, aimed at introducing the different types of financial markets and their key participants. I’ve since decided to expand that foundation into a more complete course, going deeper into the bond, equity, and derivatives markets.

My ambition is to eventually tackle more advanced topics like instrument pricing and portfolio strategies. But above all, my initial goal is simple: help you make sense of financial jargon and market conversations when, for example, your colleague starts bragging about making a fortune by buying bonds from a company with an "undervalued market capitalization". Understanding finance has never been more crucial. In a world where many countries are grappling with high inflation, rising debt levels, and economic uncertainty, we are constantly exposed to “experts” — some trying to sell you get-rich-quick trading programs, others using financial arguments to push political agendas.

That’s why this course aims to be clear, honest, and accessible. As I continue to learn and gain feedback, the content may evolve. But for now, here’s the current outline:

1) [Introduction](/financial-markets-intro/introduction.md): Overview of financial markets, key participants, and common financial instruments.
2) (Incoming) Interest Rates & Time Value of Money: The core financial concept behind all valuations.
3) (Incoming) Bond Markets: Deep dive into different types of bonds and how to price them.
4) (Incoming) Equity Markets: Key principles, valuation indicators, and how technical and fundamental analysis are applied.
5) (Incoming) Derivatives:
    - Part 1: Forwards, futures, and swaps.
    - Part 2: Options and related strategies.
