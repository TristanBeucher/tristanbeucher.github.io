title: Navigating the pitfalls of data projects

This note is based on an [article](https://seattledataguy.substack.com/p/navigating-the-pitfalls-of-data-projects) from the Seattle Data Guy’s newsletter, a publication about data engineering and data project management. I keep the steps defined in the article and add my own remarks.

It highlights several good practices to apply from the start to the completion of any data project:

### 1) Start with the end in mind

The first step is to perform backward planning: think about the desired outcomes first, and work backwards from there. Define goals, activities, effort required, and key dependencies.

*You don't want to fall into the "technical success, business failure" trap by creating a technically perfect model disaligned with business stakes.* 

### 2) Keep things moving

Someone, usually the project owner, should ensure that progress continues at a reasonable pace. When blockers arise:
- Help teams prioritize
- Facilitate meetings between stakeholders to unblock situations
- Set clear deadlines with clear expectations for task completion

### 3) Define "Clear Done"

Each task or feature must have a clearly defined “done” state, a point after which it should no longer be modified or reopened. This ensures stability and prevents scope creep once a deliverable is completed.

### 4) Have clear landmarks

Keep the team engaged and motivated by setting clear milestones. These provide visibility into progress and create opportunities to celebrate achievements along the way.

*Landmarks can also include early wins or prototypes shown to stakeholders, this helps maintain buy-in during long-running projects.*

### 5) Publicize your project

Communicate about your project both internally and externally to raise its visibility and encourage engagement. Use emails or internal social platforms to share updates and progress.

*Publicizing progress not only raises visibility but can also surface new stakeholders, users, or use cases that were not initially identified.*

### 6) Clearly define the end of the project

Clearly defining project completion is essential. Without this, team members may disengage once the project feels “almost done” (e.g. at 98%). Establish a shared understanding of what constitutes project completion to maintain commitment through the final steps.

*You can also plan for a final phase of structured knowledge transfer and maintenance handover, this helps ensure long-term impact and avoids the "project abandoned after delivery" risk.*
