Here are my reading notes from “The Hapiness of Pursuit”, a book written by Chris Guillebeau, an american entrepreneur, famous for his blog “The Art of Non conformity” (and his book of the same name). I tried to keep it short and give what are, in my opinion, the most significant examples from the book. At the end of this summary, I’ve added two applications of the advices given in the book


## Key Message

Embarking on a quest can lead to happiness as it provides a clear direction and purpose in our lives. Throughout the journey, you will encounter new challenges that will shape and transform you. Rather than idling on the sofa, you will be actively acquiring new skills, gaining experiences, and exploring new horizons, all in pursuit of a significant and fulfilling objective.


## What is a quest ?

This book delves into the heart of ‘quests’ — a term defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as ‘a long search for something that is difficult to find, or an attempt to achieve something difficult.’

Indeed, all quests have in common that they include numerous challenges, and their true goal is often more about the journey than the endpoint:

> a quest is a journey that heads toward a specific, life-affirming goal.

Chris Guillebeau gives the example of Tom Allen’s adventure. A fresh-faced British graduate, Allen chose to go cycling around the world over a lucrative job, despite being inexperienced as both a cyclist and a traveler. His was a journey replete with hurdles, yet through determination, he not only completed his expedition but also returned with a wealth of insights — an experience he could not have obtained by staying in Great Britain.


## Why you need to start a quest

Adding purpose to your life is one reason to embark on a quest. Stephanie Zito, who had worked for 15 years in nonprofits, became disillusioned by the wasteful bureaucracy she had witnessed. In response, she created a project called #Give10, committing to donate $10 a day to charity. This project led her to discover many inspiring small charities. The sense of purpose Stephanie Zito found in her quest was amplified because it was directed toward a noble cause.

The remarkable transformation in self-assurance and strength it can foster is another compelling motive for pursuing a quest is. Consider Nate Damm’s transformation: once a self-described introvert, his ambitious trek across the United States forced him to engage with strangers, seeking a place to rest each night. These interactions helped him become more confident and independent. A personal quest, then, isn’t merely a journey; it’s an opportunity to shatter the barriers we erect around our insecurities.

Ultimately, quests enable us to grow by expanding our perspectives in the world. The journey is filled with new experiences; it can inspire us to imagine new challenges (such as embarking on another quest) or to become more creative in our everyday existence.


## Why is a quest so rewarding ?

The author consistently advocates that quests can change people’s lives and improve individuals for the better, as illustrated by the story of Nate Damm.

Moreover, pursuing something you love is rewarding in and of itself. As the adage goes, “the journey is more important than the destination,” and this is particularly true in the context of embarking on a quest. It’s important to recognize that not every moment of the journey will be enjoyable; in fact, most quests demand significant effort, persistence, and dedication. However, the process of continuous self-improvement yields an unmatched sense of pride and accomplishment.”


## When do quests start ?

Bob Dylan once said in an interview with Rolling Stone, “everyone has a calling” — a motivating passion that could serve as the catalyst for a quest. Some people discover their quest early on, as is the case with many athletes who know from their teenage years that they want to become professionals.

However, for a significant number of people, the calling must be triggered by external factors. It can be unforeseen, uncontrollable external factors, such as in Sandi Wheaton’s story. She embarked on a quest to document her journey on Route 66 after she was laid off from her job at General Motors. The author emphasizes the critical impact of discontent, explaining it using the following equation: dissatisfaction + a big idea + the willingness to take action = the start of a new adventure.

Another opportune moment for people to start a quest is… following the completion of another quest. There are two reasons behind this:

1. they need to restore a sense of purpose to their life, as their previous quest has been completed
2. their previous quest has opened new opportunities to them, widening their scope in the world. People who have just completed a quest often feel more confident to start a new one and accomplish incredible things.


## How to achieve the journey ?

No quest is too grandiose or expensive, as the author explains; it’s always possible to adapt your dream quest to your personal circumstances. He shares his own story as an example: his aspiration was to visit every one of the 197 countries in the world, which initially seemed too expensive and time-consuming. However, when he calculated the costs for the first 50 countries, he discovered that visiting these countries would amount to around $30,000 and take five to seven years to complete — a more feasible endeavor if he lived frugally for a few years.

Once you have identified your quest, you still have to achieve it. The book offers three main pieces of advice:

- Believe in yourself: Since many people may not understand what you are doing or attempting to do, you must be firmly convinced of its value.
- Divide your quest into manageable tasks: This approach will help you achieve intermediate goals and celebrate successes along the way before reaching the final destination of your quest.
- Derive energy from rejection and failure: Jia Jiang transformed rejection into motivation, spending 100 days deliberately seeking rejection by making peculiar requests to strangers. His objective was to discard his fear of rejection to be able to try anything

**What if you fail?** In reality, failure provides valuable information about whether you are on the right path. Mark Boyle initially aimed to walk to India but lost motivation early on due to language barriers on the French coast. He subsequently realized that he had pursued an unsuitable quest, as his true aspiration was to live his life without money. Consequently, the failure guided him towards a new, fitting quest.


## Application

Take some time to think about your dissatisfaction, your insecurities and your joy in your current life. Visualize who you would like to be in one, two or ten years and try to imagine a challenge big enough to allow you to become this person.
If you are not ready for a big change, experiment with making small, positive changes in your life for a week. Consider removing your television, engaging in conversations with strangers wherever you go, or using your lunch break to explore an art museum. Implementing these minor tweaks can have a profound impact on your life and inspire you to take on more ambitious objectives.
